# About Me

<img src="imgs/selfie-algo.jpg" width="35%" style="float:right; margin-left:20px; margin-bottom:10px;">

My name is Xulin Zhou(周旭林), a graduate student at [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences(ISCAS)](http://www.is.cas.cn/) in Beijing. I graduated from [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/main.htm)  with a bachelor's degree in 2023. I was born and bred in Dongguan.

**My research interests lie in *Parallel Computing and Compiler Optimization***. As a member of [PLCT lab](https://github.com/plctlab/PLCT-Weekly), I have served as a maintainer and contributor to several open-source compiler projects. See my personal statement [here](/projects/PS.md).

**Writing is my long-standing habit.** I have been keeping a diary since high school. Parts of the diaries are organized as [several columns](/blogs/main.md) to summarize miscellaneous insights from my experiences and reading. 
<!-- I take photos and organize them into photography work.
I also have a deep appreciation for music. -->

Living in the city, I **"cityrun"** regularly to explore different neighborhoods. When I am outdoors, I like [trekking](photography/2024-wusun/main.md) which opens up new ways of experiencing life. I also like playing ping pong, badminton, volleyball and shuttlecock, always more for fun than at a competitive level.
